                <p>Back in 2012, I decided to try my hand at creating custom Tumblr themes and tumbled head first into
                    the rabbit hole
                    of
                    coding and web development. Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of building software
                    for an
                    advertising
                    agency, a start-up, a student-led design studio, and a huge corporation.</p>
                <p>My main focus these days is building products and leading projects for our clients at Upstatement. In
                    my free time
                    I've
                    also released an online video course that covers everything you need to know to build a web app with
                    the Spotify
                    API.</p>
                <p>When I’m not at the computer, I’m usually rock climbing, hanging out with my wife and two cats, or
                    running around
                    Hyrule
                    searching for Korok seeds.</p>
